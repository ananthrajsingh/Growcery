# Growcery

This is a (very) basic grocery 🥚🍅 list Android application, following the (very) best 🙌 Android practices at it's heart.
Under the hood, it implements new Android libraries and classes like `Room`, `LiveData` and `ViewModel`, with other not-so-new libraries and classes. This application is mainly a learning project rather than a production application.
